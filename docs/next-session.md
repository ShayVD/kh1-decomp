Continue kh1-decomp, the matching decomp of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix (PS2), retail `SLPS_251.98`, SHA-256 1993a4da…. Read README.md and everything in docs/ first; they are the only notes carried between sessions. My own `SLPS_251.98` is in my Downloads folder (never commit it); in a cloud container a copy is in the project files' uploads folder (check its SHA-256 against kh1.toml).

## The Mac

**The Mac is away until Monday 2026-10-26** (the user said so on 2026-10-23).
If this session starts before then (sessions 49 to 69 ran without it), do not ask for the Mac or wait on it: skip items 1
to 3, add every float change to docs/float-untested.md as untested, and do the static items. **From Monday 2026-10-26
on, ask for the Mac and PCSX2 at the start** (the connect card in the Claude desktop app) **and make item 1 the first
thing**: seven float builds are waiting for a boot. Items 2 and 3 also need the Mac: the user's ISO is in Downloads for the host
run, and the overlay files are in Downloads/kh1-test/ovl.

## Where we stopped (end of session 69, 2026-10-24)

- **6,979 / 6,988 functions matched** (docs/progress.md). No matching work in sessions 27-69.
- **Seven default float builds are unbooted**: sessions 30 (2,100 float), 31 (2,047), 32 (2,043), 33 (2,032), 34
  (2,049, unchanged in 35 to 58), 59 (2,053, unchanged in 60 to 68) and **69 (2,043, the current default)**: session
  69 made 21 objects one definition (vita-port-plan 5.1i), so 10 objects that floated in place as parts of a run
  now float whole into the float area (the shop / list windows D_0062F6E0 / D_0062F790 / D_00630460, the ppp matrices
  D_00615E70 / D_00616000, D_0052EB50, D_00551700, D_00575900, the timer sets D_006692F0 / D_00669320) and 20
  neighbours are pinned; the undo is reverting that commit (float-untested.md row 69). docs/float-untested.md lists
  every change since the last booted build (KH1_F29_N) and the switch that undoes each. Session 59 released 4 names
  (`--no-fmt-read`, low risk); session 34 released 19 (bisect order `--no-hix-join`, `--no-widen-heads`,
  `--no-likely-slot`).
- **Register passthrough** (portability.md rule 10; vita-port-plan.md §5.1c-§5.1e): argcheck lists **0 short
  calls and 3 value uses**: func_001ffaf0 (winmenu.c), func_002040a0 and func_00206710 (winpart.c) have no
  caller in the main ELF; check them against dktitle.x's calls into the main ELF. BENIGN keys may name the
  caller (a third field).
- **Calls through pointers** (`python3 -I tools/host/indcheck.py [--all] [--tsv out/host/indcheck.tsv]`,
  vita-port-plan.md §5.1e-§5.1h): **0 `?`, 0 DATA, 0 OPEN, 0 `?def`** (session 68). 242 rows: 117 OK, 42 READ,
  70 OVERLAY, 13 CLANG (gcc nested functions in ppp/keshptail(x), kethdraw; a draft's `$10`). Session 68:
  ASM_TAKES holds the parameters of assembly / SDK targets read by hand (FlushCache, iFlushCache, the libvu0
  RotMatrix trio, SyncDCache), and a piece called as one pointer reaches its first `.word` only. Session 67: PSys.mods are &D_00370200[id] (the words
  pppRelocProgram relocates), so pppsys.c's system steps call PppClass fn10 (never set) / fn14 / fn18 (all
  take nothing); the Range52 is func_0010f558's choice list (msgwin / list / shop, FIELD_SAME). The 70
  OVERLAY rows (vm_lib's 41 hooks, mcstep's request hook 13, partyctl's cb44 4, textwin's x0 2, the setters
  func_001c06c0 / func_001468f8 / func_0012cab8, D_00304B6C, D_002E27D4, D_00616220, func_0011f228, vmath's
  handler stack, gumisave's two overlay entry calls) are for the dktitle.x / overlay check.
- **Argument classes** (portability.md rule 11): `python3 -I tools/host/abicheck.py` (text) and indcheck
  (trees) both 0. Run both after any new declaration. indcheck: **0 CLANG** (session 69: the three nested-function
  files are CLANG-READ, read from their gcc host objects, which have no `call *`).
- **Layout dependencies** (portability.md rule 12, vita-port-plan.md §5.1i): `python3 -I tools/host/layoutcheck.py`
  (after `make shift` and `make host-census`) lists code that reaches past its variable's host definition: **0 rows**
  (86 at the start of session 69; 10 false positives in its REVIEWED table). census.py keeps names with no C
  definition at their PS2 distances (out/host/defs_host.c blocks) and aliases names inside a C definition into it
  (out/host/aliases.ld); shift_ld.py lets such a field name follow its floated object. Keep it at 0 after any data
  change: a new row is a host crash waiting (opdma in 64, the notice in 68 were found by crashing).
- **Null platform**: PlatMcSync answers done with "no card" (-10) and PlatMcGetInfo writes its outputs;
  PlatPadRead leaves no button pressed, PlatPadGetButtonProfile answers -1. PlatSifCallRpc answers RPC 0x30
  with 1 (session 66), and (session 67) keeps the sound status block's address from RPC 0 and, a frame after
  a queue (RPC 30), takes the bank transfers it held (commands 3, 4, 0xB) off the block's +0x1F00 count
  (D_0063F540): boot waits for it non-zero, the sound tasks / summons / soft reset for 0; unanswered it stayed
  2. The other status words read 0, which every reader takes as "nothing playing" / "no disc error".
  **DMAC interrupts** (session 68): the null platform keeps PlatAddDmacHandler's handlers, a status bit per
  channel (set by PlatDmaSend / PlatDmaPutVif1Chcr with STR, cleared by PlatDmaPutStat) and the enable mask, and
  runs an enabled channel's handlers outside any handler: mdlgs.c's GS task list ends (D_00559DB4) and
  func_0015ef60's frame-end wait returns.
  **Threads** (session 67, host/null/threads.c): the game's threads run as ucontext coroutines (a thread runs
  from the main thread's PlatWaitSema until it waits; semaphores count; PlatIReferSemaStatus reports the
  waiters). This runs src/util/thread.c's loader worker: every func_001204a0 file load reads on it (before,
  a load's result stayed -1 for ever).
- **Host build (phase 5)**: `make host-census` links out/host/kh1-host (all 512 game files + the 8 drafts).
  `KH1_HOST_ISO=PATH out/host/kh1-host` reads the user's own disc image by sector (host/port/cd_image.c;
  `KH1_HOST_TRACE=1` prints the searches and reads, `KH1_HOST_FRAMES=N` caps the run, default 600). On
  tests/host/fake_disc.py's image (now with a one-sector "dktitle.x" in KINGDOM.IDX) the boot reads SYSTEM.CNF,
  KINGDOM.IDX and dktitle.x (frame 2, on the loader thread) and calls D_00F20000(0, 0), which faults:
  main.c prints "fault at PS2 0x00f20000 in the memory map" and the caller. **`KH1_HOST_OVL=stub`** (session
  68, a test switch in host/null/main.c) answers the entry with 0 instead (the main loop then stays in the
  title's state 1); **`KH1_HOST_OVL=stub:2`** also asks for state 2 with func_00109558 (a guess at the title's
  "new game"), and the boot then loads dh.wdt, amusic/sedh.dat, dh00_01.bin, dh00_01.img, dh01.ard (Dive to the
  Heart) and, on the fake disc where those files are missing, ends in func_00132790 (roomobj.nostrict.c) on
  data that is not there. The stub does not work under valgrind (valgrind runs the overlay's bytes). **Valgrind: 0 errors** up to the
  fault (`apt-get install valgrind libc6-dbg:i386`; under valgrind the fault is a SIGILL). **Not yet run on the
  real ISO** (it is on the Mac): it should stop at the same call. opdma.c's three GS tag lists are one
  definition (D_0061EEA0[0x140]); session 68 made the notice's four sprite sets one (src/hud/notice.nostrict.c
  `D_00656230_sets[4][9]`): func_00243a90's fill ran over D_006561D0 on the host. Session 69 found the rest statically
  (layoutcheck, 21 more objects one definition); the stub:2 run still ends in func_00132790 on the fake disc.
- **dktitle.x**: tools/ovl/inventory.py is ready (functions, main-ELF calls and data, code / data split;
  `--selftest` on the main ELF finds every layout.tsv start). Not run: the file is on the Mac. §5.2 has the plan
  to decompile it (toolchain check on 5-8 leaves first).
- **Original source names** (docs/elf-notes.md): ttlib/ui_gauge.c, ttlib/ui.c, src/decode.c, src/sa_task.c, with
  their ranges; none below 0x001c08e8 so far.
- **Helpers:** `python3 -I tools/shift/s50move/group.py src/DIR/NAME LO HI` drafts modules per flag mode,
  `tools/shift/s37move/fcheck.sh base|NAME` (compare float_covered.txt as a sorted set; run `base` on a clean tree
  before any edit, and never run `make` while it builds; a syms line naming a func_ alias that went away is
  expected after a rename), `tools/shift/cover_check.py | grep NAME`, `tools/checkfile.py FILE -v`,
  `tools/shift/s31types/s31_warndiff.py FILES` (compares with HEAD: commit-free check). Data definitions: compare
  `cut -f2 out/gen/data.tsv | sort` with the session's base (saved before the first edit). reach_check alone (40 s,
  no build): `python3 -I tools/shift/reach_check.py --elf SLPS_251.98 --overlays EMPTYDIR --out F.txt` (after a
  `make shift`; the anchors come from out/shift/kh1-shift.linked.elf). Host: `make host-census` (or
  `python3 -I tools/host/census.py --exe`), then `out/host/kh1-host` (gdb works: objects have -g; `gdb -batch -ex
  "break kh1_host_vblank if frames >= N" -ex run -ex bt out/host/kh1-host` shows where frame N is); `--files
  CAUSE` / `--show FILE`; out/host/undefined.txt. `python3 -I tools/host/argcheck.py --tsv out/host/argcheck.tsv`
  lists the passthrough calls, `python3 -I tools/host/abicheck.py` the argument-class mismatches. `python3 -I tools/host/vu2c.py FILE LINE` turns one VU0 asm statement into PlatVu0
  calls. A quick "did any object change" check: `find out/build -name '*.o' | sort | xargs sha1sum` before the
  first edit and after (sessions 62 to 66 did this), or build origin/main in a `git worktree`
  (symlink tools/toolchain, copy the ELF) and `cmp` every out/build .o.
  **`git fetch origin main` first**: the container's origin/main can be stale. A fresh container needs `apt-get
  install libc6:i386 libstdc++5:i386 binutils-mips-linux-gnu gcc-multilib gdb` (indcheck needs clang, present in the cloud image) (after `dpkg --add-architecture
  i386`), `make toolchain`, the ELF, a plain `make shift` and tools/shift/data_owners.py before `fcheck.sh base`.

## What is left (9 functions)

Best drafts are in nonmatchings/session23-match/ and older (table in its NOTES.md). Counts are LCS words.

1. **1-4 words**: 001fd858 (1, reorg liveness), 001f2630 (1, nofill), 001f1fc8 (2, nofill), 00265608 (4, closed).
2. **15-24 words**: 001c62a0 (15), 00200e28 (24).
3. **Large**: 00110618 (93, FP register permutation), 0010d470 (170, jump2 cross-jumping), 001636d0 (394, gcse build).

## Session 70 plan (at most 3 workers, docs/workflow.md "Resource limit")

1. **Boot test (only with the Mac, from Monday 2026-10-26)**: run a plain `make shift`, tools/shift/data_owners.py,
   stage out/overlays from Downloads/kh1-test/ovl, `make shift SHIFT_MODE=m12 SHIFT_FLOAT=1`, copy the ELF to
   Downloads/kh1-test/s70 and /mnt/project-files/kh1-runtime/s70, patch KH1_BIG.iso, and run the route in
   docs/float-untested.md (include a shop, the in-game menu: the top menu, the item, equipment, abilities,
   customize, status, config and journal pages with each journal section, changing a config option, using an
   item, equipping a weapon, a save point (save to a card, overwrite a save, change the party), loading a save from
   the title screen, a new game's name entry if one is reachable, buying and selling in an item shop and a Gummi
   shop, the Moogle's synthesis, the title screen left idle until its demo, a battle with the HUD (the HP / MP
   gauges, command menu, lock-on and the target's gauge, damage numbers, an "obtained" notice: src/hud/notice.c,
   whose sprite sets session 68 made one array), the world map's gauge, a minigame with a timer or score if one is
   near (session 69 floated the HUD timer's sprite sets), a level-up, a Trinity mark if one is near, a summon if one
   is available, enemy drops picked up, the pause (src/game/pause.c), a game over and its continue
   (src/game/gameover.c), a room change and a world change (src/game/roomload.c), a movie (src/game/dkmovie.c), and
   anything using atan: camera, lock-on). If it breaks, bisect: session 69's commit first (revert it: the
   one-definition merges), then session 59's `--no-fmt-read`, then session 34's switches. Move what boots into
   docs/shiftable-plan.md and clear docs/float-untested.md. Note what the boot shows about the "(a guess)" modules
   and rename the ones it settles. Without the Mac: skip.
2. **Host run on the real disc (with the Mac)**: ask once for the user's ISO (Downloads; the unpatched original,
   not KH1_BIG.iso) to be copied into the container's scratchpad (never into the repo or project files), run
   `KH1_HOST_ISO=... KH1_HOST_TRACE=1 out/host/kh1-host` (and once under valgrind): expected, as on the fake disc,
   SYSTEM.CNF, KINGDOM.IDX and the eight files before dktitle.x, then the fault at D_00F20000(0, 0). Then
   **`KH1_HOST_OVL=stub:2`** on the real disc: the Dive to the Heart files (dh.wdt ... dh01.ard) are there, so the
   room parse (func_00132790) gets real data; record in vita-port-plan how far it gets and where it stops. Fix
   host-only causes the way sessions 63 to 69 did (platform answers, layout dependencies as one definition with
   layoutcheck at 0, the PS2 ELF byte-identical).
3. **dktitle.x (with the Mac)**: copy Downloads/kh1-test/ovl/dktitle.x into the container (never commit it), run
   `python3 -I tools/ovl/inventory.py dktitle.x --tsv out/ovl/dktitle.layout.tsv`, record the counts (not the bytes)
   in §5.2, then the toolchain check of §5.2 step 2 on 5-8 small leaf functions. Check argcheck's 3 value uses and
   func_002066b0's BENIGN entry against dktitle.x's calls into the main ELF, and indcheck's OVERLAY rows
   (does dktitle.x call the setters func_001c06c0 / func_001468f8 / func_0012cab8 or write vm_lib's hooks? what do
   the targets take?). Does it call func_00109558, and with which states (session 68 guessed 2 = new game)?
   Without the Mac: skip.
4. **Static, without the Mac**: (a) **the unbounded index rows**: `layoutcheck.py --all` adds 733 rows (726
   idx-next: an index with no bound the analysis can see, from a base to the next host run; 7 uncached DMA
   buffers). Most are tables indexed within their size, but some are one array split in two the way session 69's
   D_00629E70 / D_0062A130 was (the open windows indexed to [4]). Sort them by what the next run is (a name with no
   C definition right after a C array, two arrays in the same file, a struct's last field) and read the likely
   ones: the C type's count against the loop or compare that bounds the index; make the real ones one definition
   (kh1.elf byte-identical; float-untested.md row for any float change). Add a REVIEWED-style note for the read
   ones so the list shrinks. (b) argcheck's 3 value uses still wait for dktitle.x. Keep every PS2 object the same
   except for such one-definition merges.
5. **Matching (optional, 1 worker)**: only with a new idea (001c62a0 or the nofill pair).
6. End with `make progress-update SESSION=70`, commit, open a PR, and refresh this prompt (keep the Mac note
   accurate).
