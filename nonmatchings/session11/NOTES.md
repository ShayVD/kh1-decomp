# Session 11 worker notes (condensed from the workers' reports)

## s11w1 (001c3b10 001c2ec8 001cf960 001c99a8 001c5ee8 001c95f8): 5 matches
- 001c2ec8 (hand): `extern s32 D_002C5950[]; fl = &D_002C5950[2];` for the loop's D_002C5958: a
  different RTL address `(const (plus D_002C5950 8))`, so gcse does not share it with the top
  `D_002C5958 |= 0xc`. Also 0w: `&D_002C5950 + 2`, `&D_002C5910[4][2]`, a struct with `.fl` at +8.
  A cast of D_002C5958 itself keeps the symbol_ref (20w).
- 001c3b10 (hand, strict; was measured in nostrict): x18-loop message fields stored straight from
  `w` in struct order.
- 001cf960 (hand): VM flags at 0x328 as `u64 b0:1, b1:1, rest:62;` directly in the struct.
- 001c99a8 (hand, CONTEXT_ONLY func_001c6890): Cam punning union -> u64 bitfields in Cam.
- 001c95f8 (hand): dur0 at +4 sits inside the flags word, so the union stays; store through
  `{ f32 *p = &D_003C5510.u.s.dur0; *p = d; }`.
- 001c5ee8 11 LCS (w1__001c5ee8_11w.c): identical two-store arms `if (p) lk_init(..) else lk_init(..)`
  lift lk 5 -> 9 refs (B, i*224, lk right); needs 7-8 refs exactly or i >= 10.
- Facts: a u64 bitfield store gets the containing struct's alias set; one-store identical arms
  merge before register allocation (no refs gained), two-store arms survive to jump2.

## s11w4 (001502e8 001b9f78 00169688 00169f28 0019f1f0 00152928 001ba520 00192958): 2 matches
- 001b9f78 (hand): loop 2 reads `D_006202A0.n` / `.e[i].id` directly, no `p = &D_006202A0` local
  (its a0 preference put `i = 0` after the test).
- 00169f28 (hand, rodata 0x48E8E0): each 0.1f `continue` test as identical arms on live `p`:
  `{ f32 a = v; if (p) { if (0.1f < a) continue; } else { if (0.1f < a) continue; } }`: refs on
  the hoisted 0.1f only, so it beats `best` for f20. Other conditions reorder integer priorities.
  D_0048E8D4 (0x7fffffff) is part of 00169f28's own rodata (a static const read as f32).
- 001502e8 2w: local-alloc 3-quantity exchange (needs pri(Q) > pri(C), all block-local); ~10 shapes.
- 00169688 really 4w (LCS 20 = the same 4 words shifting targets): case 10's
  `b L+4; ld v1,48(a2); nop`; probably a block reorg deleted after redirecting into it. 20 shapes.
- 0019f1f0 7 (nostrict, rodata 0x48fcb0): `li s0,2` bltz slot, func_002672f8 arg move order,
  late m[3][3] = 1.0f store. 00152928 9 (nostrict; the stub gain was hand-only): gcse PRE copy.
  001ba520 15: 288 flag-block orders, sibling decls. 00192958 17: TImode constant tie.
- Facts: `do { } while (0)` does not loop-weight REG_N_REFS; plain-global access over a pointer
  local again (sibling-port lesson).
