/* Per-frame GPU memory: the vertex and uniform rings a renderer writes each batch into.
 *
 * A ring is nslots equal slots, one per frame in flight (two = double-buffered: the GPU reads frame n's slot while
 * the CPU writes frame n + 1's).  vpk_ring_alloc bumps the current slot's head (aligned); vpk_ring_frame moves to the
 * next slot and starts it empty, so nothing is ever freed one by one.  The caller must not write a slot before the
 * GPU is done with the frame that last used it (on the Vita a notification or sceGxmFinish per frame: the ring does
 * not wait).  An allocation that does not fit in what is left of the slot returns 0 and is counted (`overflows`):
 * the caller drops or splits the batch; nothing wraps into the slot the GPU may be reading.  A frame that wrote
 * nothing keeps its slot, so a GPU thread that runs an empty frame's job without waiting is never overtaken.
 *
 * No system headers, so a game can build it with its own types and flags.
 * From kh1-decomp include/platform/ring.h and host/port/ring.c @ 85befa4a. */
